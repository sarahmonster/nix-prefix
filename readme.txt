== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't this work with my theme? =

This plugin doesn't work with all themes—yet! It's currently filtering the standard `the_archive_title` function, which was added to core in 4.1, released December 2014. If your theme is more than a year old, there's a good chance it will be using a non-standard function instead, which is more of a challenge to filter consistently.

If you'd like to use this plugin and it doesn't work with your theme, please [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/sarahmonster/nix-prefix/issues/new) and I'll work on adding support for your particular theme.

= How do I customise the prefixes? =

The best way to customise your output is by using CSS. The [CSS snippets section here](https://github.com/sarahmonster/nix-prefix/blob/master/README.md#css-code-snippets) should help you get started.

To dequeue the plugin's custom CSS, copy the following line into your theme's `functions.php`

    function nix_prefix_dequeue_plugin_styles()  {
        wp_dequeue_style( 'nix-prefix-style' );
    }
    add_action( 'wp_print_styles', 'nix_prefix_dequeue_plugin_styles', 100 );

= What archive page types does this work with? =

This works for all archive page types:

* category archives
* tag archives
* authors archives
* date archives
* custom post types archives
* custom taxonomy archives

You can customise the display for different archive types by using targeted [CSS classes](https://github.com/sarahmonster/nix-prefix/blob/master/README.md#css-code-snippets).
